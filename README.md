#### Lab 1 - chapter 3 ~ Numbers

### Lab Reflection
In this Lab i learned a lot of things. One thing i learned was that the round function rounds to the nearest even digit. As much as i used the round method in my coding career that particular information was new to me and interesting now that i think about it. i also found it interesting that float does not return the precise number that is being added, i actually found it more interesting that most studies that you would thing would want an accurate representation of data but they actually like to keep that room for error.


Overall i believe this section gave me a better understanding of numbers being more than numbers you can count.Many different studies may require a number to be represented a different way. For an example a finance firm may want a more accurate and precise representation of a number while scientist want the same number dont mind giving up the computational power and settling for a less precise number.


Numbers can be complex meaning having imaginary numbers, numbers can be in a fraction form, numbers can in a matrix which allows you to manipulate a big list of number at once and in different dimensions. In python numbers can be converted into bytes,hex,and octs with just a call to a function making it easy to convert the representation of a number.
